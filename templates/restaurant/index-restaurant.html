    <p>
        While using biometrics to make an account for commodities such as restaurants seems
        unlikely, the possibility for future wide-spread implementation and usage of biometrics still stands.<br>
        Users are likely to be concerned with the security of their biometrics in systems owned by public
        corporations; unlike mobile devices, these biometric templates will have to be stored
        externally for wide-spread use in applications such as those presented in this concept run.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is likely for commodity-based corporations such as Amazon, McDonalds, Walmart, and many others to take
        biometric signatures and use them for applications against the user's consent. These phenomena are attributed
        to data-creepage; visible today with the presence of data brokers and the selling of excess data obtained from
        customer interactions with the aforementioned entities.<br>
        by design, biometric templates are composed of values which uniquely identify the individual. This makes them
        ripe for the gathering of physical and mental data such as medical conditions, states of health, cultural
        background, and much more.
    </p>
    <h2>It is for these reasons that a trusted third party is required for the collection and storage of biometric
        signatures for wide-spread use.</h2>
    <p>A trusted third party would ensure that the templates collected aren't used for further distribution or commercial gain.
        Securing the user's privacy while still following U.S. laws and practices.
